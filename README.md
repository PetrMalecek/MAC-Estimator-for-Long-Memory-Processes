As argued notably by Kruse et al. (2016): "Comparing Predictive Accuracy under Long Memory - With an Application to Volatility Forecasting", long memory can be transmitted into loss differentials in the Durbin-Mariano statistics, possibly causing a severe bias.
This piece of code calculates both the values of the Diebold-Mariano statistic and the memory and autocorrelation consistent (MAC) estimator. This estimator is asymptotically valid even for long-memory processes.
